                <h1>Beed</h1><br>
                <p>Beed district has a long history of many rulers and kingdoms. In the ancient era, this city was called as Bhir. The city still proudly shows some old monuments showing the signs of past glory in the form of many city entry doors (called Ves or Darwaza in local language) and city protection walls. Until the 1st May 1960, this part of Marathwada was under Hyderabad State, but was later included into the Indian Republic after a fierce struggle between Indian Government and Nizam soldiers (Razakars). as The name of Bhir is given by Mohammad Tughlaq. </p>
