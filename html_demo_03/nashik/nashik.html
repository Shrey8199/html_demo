          The Western Ghats or Sahyadri range stretches from north to south
          across the western portion of the district. With the exception of the
          westernmost few villages, the western portion is hilly, and
          intersected by ravines, and only the simplest kind of cultivation is
          possible. The western slope of the Ghats is drained by several rivers,
          including the Daman Ganga River, which drains westwards to the Arabian
          Sea. The larger eastern portion of the district, which lies on the
          Deccan Plateau, is open, fertile, and well cultivated. The
          Satmala-Chandwad Range, which runs east and west, forms the chief
          divide of the plateau region. Peninsular India's largest river
          Godavari originates in the district in the Trimbakeshwar Range and
          continues eastwards through the district.[4] The Satmala-Chandwad
          Range forms a watershed, such that, the rivers emerging to its south
          drain into the Godavari. These include the Kadva and Darna both of
          which are tributaries of the Godavari. To the north of the
          Satmala-Chandwad Range, the Girna River and its tributary, the Mosam,
          flow eastward through fertile valleys into the Tapti River. The
          Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple is located in Trimbak, one of the twelve
          Jyotirlingas, where a set of Hindu genealogy registers at
          Trimbakeshwar are maintained. The origin of the sacred Godavari River
          is at Brahmagiri peak near Trimbak.
