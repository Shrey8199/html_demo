          Although Ahmednagar district was created as early as 1818, modern
          history of Ahmednagar may be said to have commenced from 1869, the
          year when parts of Nashik and Solapur, which till then had comprised
          Nagar, were separated and the present Nagar district was formed.
          Ahmednagar District was created after the defeat of the Maratha Empire
          in the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1818, when most of the Peshwa's
          domains were annexed to British India. The district remained part of
          the Central division of Bombay Presidency until India's independence
          in 1947, when it became part of Bombay State, and in 1960 the new
          state of Maharashtra. The district along with its namesake city were
          renamed to Ahilyanagar in 2023 by the government of Eknath Shinde, in
          honour of Ahilyabai Holkar, the Rani of Indore; the move faced some
          criticism.[2][3]
