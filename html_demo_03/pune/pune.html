          According to archaeological discoveries of the Jorwe culture in
          Chandoli and Inamgaon, portions of the district have been occupied by
          humans since the Chalcolithic (the Copper Age, 5thâ€“4th millennium
          BCE).[5] Many ancient trade routes linking ports in western India
          (particularly those of coastal Konkan) with the Deccan Plateau pass
          through the district. The town of Junnar has been an important trading
          and political center for the last two thousand years, and it was first
          mentioned by Greco-Roman travellers in the early first millennium
          CE.[6][7][8] The Karla Caves in Karli, near Lonavala, are near the
          Western Ghats and a major ancient trade route running eastward from
          the Arabian Sea to the Deccan Plateau. The caves are a complex of
          ancient Indian Buddhist rock-cut shrines which were developed from the
          second century BCE to the fifth century CE; the oldest of the shrines
          is believed to date to 160 BCE. Traders and Satvahana rulers financed
          construction of the caves.[9] Buddhists, identified with commerce and
          manufacturing through their early association with traders, tended to
          locate their monasteries in natural formations near major trade routes
          to provide lodging for travelling traders.[10] Inscriptions at Karla
          and Junnar suggest that in the early part of the Common Era, the area
          was controlled by the Shaka ruler Nahapana.[11] Coins found further
          east in the district, near Indapur, suggest that the region may have
          been controlled by the Traikutaka king Dahragana in 465 CE; silver
          coins found at Junnar suggest that the region may also have been ruled
          by Andhra kings.[12]
